# Deep-Learning

This is the course base provides an overview of deep learning techniques with engineering applications. Topics includes: Aneural network architectures (CNNs, RNNs, and more.), model training and regularization; data augmentation; transfer learning; generative models. 
Several skill building exercise/assignments are showned as individual projects here. And one team-based project is completed in the end as a wrapper of all the knowlegde and skills being learned in the class.
